# Bank-System
Banking system that records name, account numbers, and account balances. Overall the this project's purpose is to get me more comfortable with programming in C. 

 One of the the most interesting parts about this project is how I go about creating data structures and manipulating that data. With a Python background, I am extremely reliant on arrays/lists and dictionaries. Yet in C they are are not as simple to implment. For example, I plan on having a user's name be associated with several different accounts and balances and have this information easily accesible for the program to call on later. At the time of starting I believed the best way to go about this is to rely on nested lists and shared indecies to "connect" the required data
